## Semantic Versioning

This modlist uses semantic versioning, where given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible mod list changes. **a new game is required**
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, **a new game is recommended**
3. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

**Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time.** Read more about [Semantic Versioning here](https://semver.org/).

Due to the nature of some of the larger mods included in this mod list, a MAJOR update may be required when updating. If that is the case, consider finishing your current game before updating.

## 0.6.0
