They don't say anything, they just stand in the corner of my house and stare at me.^It's really frightening to deal with it, everytime they go away I think it's finally over but they always come back.^I should tell someone but I'm nervous, I don't want to be called names.^-Nikolai",

No matter what we do he's getting onto us.^He came to my house today and knocked for a little while.^I didn't answer the door, I don't think he's safe to talk to alone.^Sam says he's just collecting taxes or something, but I think differently.^Besides I told him I would go to him, I don't want him on my property.^-Nikolai",
    "journal.4": "Dear Journal,^My benefits are being increased, it's only by ten gold. But every bit of money helps.^I've been trying to take online classes to learn a trade, so I can work again.^But I can't seem to focus on it. I won't give up though.^-Nikolai",
    "journal.5":"Dear Journal,^My mom has been on my mind a lot lately. I really miss her like all the time.^She was my bestfriend and she understood me and my problems.^She never judged me either.^The valley is pretty cool to live in, but I have a feeling like some of the people hate me. Even if they're nice, I bet they do.^I won't confront them though. People hardly even tell the truth.^-Nikolai",
