# Preamble

The Bustling Valley is a curated modlist designed for a bigger Stardew Valley experience. Designed for experienced players, it comes with 2 big expansions (Ridgeside Village and East Scarp), and several smaller expansions including new NPCS. With an enormous variety of new crops, new artisan goods, and new recipes, you'll find something new to specialise your farm in. **It is expected that players will not add additional mods or otherwise change this modlist.**

# Installation

## Pre-Installation

These steps are only needed if you install this Modlist for the first time. If you update the Modlist, jump straight to [Updating](#updating).

### Installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

It is unlikely that you are missing this. However it is needed for MO2 and several plugins, so please download it and install it anyway from [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads). Download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019". This is a [Direct link](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) if you can't find it.

### Installing Microsoft .NET 5.0 Runtime

As Stardew Valley 1.5.5 and later is now a 64 bit release, you must install the [Microsoft .NET 5.0 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime) to play the game. Download the x64 version under "Run desktop apps". This is a [Direct link](https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/1daf85dc-291b-4bb8-812e-a0df5cdb6701/85455a4a851347de26e2901e043b81e1/windowsdesktop-runtime-5.0.12-win-x64.exe) if you can't find it.

### Steam Config

#### Disable the Steam Cloud

![Steam_General_Settings](assets/images/Steam_General_Settings.png)

Open the Properties window (right click the game in your Library -> Properties), navigate to the _General_ tab and un-tick the _Keep games saves in the Steam Cloud_.

### GoG Galaxy Config

#### Disable the Gog Galaxy Cloud

Open the Configure window (right click the game in Installed -> Manage installation -> Configure), navigate to _Features_ and un-tick _Sync local saves with the GOG Galaxy Cloud_.

### Game Config

#### Set the Game language to English

This modlist is in English, and most of the mods you find are in English. **I can not give support to people with a non-English game**.

Start the game using the game shortcut or Steam / GoG Galaxy launcher. Find the language options icon on the main menu.

![Stardew_Language_Icon](assets/images/Stardew_Language_Icon.png)

### Using Wabbajack

#### Preparations

Grab the latest release of Wabbajack from [here](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases) and place the `Wabbajack.exe` file in a _working folder_.  The recommended working folder is `C:\WJ\WabbaJack`. This folder **must not** be in a _common folders_ like your Desktop, Downloads or Program Files folder. Do not install to a *OneDrive* folder.

#### Downloading and Installing

The download and installation process can take a very long time depending on your system specs. Wabbajack will calculate the amount of threads it will use at the start of the installation. To have the highest amount of threads and thus the fastest speed, it is advised to have the working folder on an SSD.

##### Automatic - Recommended

1. Open Wabbajack.
2. Click on **Browse Modlists**. Under Games, select Stardew Valley. Select The Bustling Valley from the selection.
3. Set the _installation location_. The recommended installation location is `C:\WJ\TBV`.  This folder **must not** be in a _common folders_ like your Desktop, Downloads or Program Files folder. **The rest of this document will assume you are using the recommended installation path.** Do not install to a *OneDrive* folder.
4. Set the _download location_. The recommended download location is `C:\WJ\TBV_downloads`.  This folder **must not** be in a _common folders_ like your Desktop, Downloads or Program Files folder. Do not install to a *OneDrive* folder.
5. Check **Overwrite Installation**
6. Click the Go/Begin button
7. Wait for Wabbajack to finish
8. If you run into any issues see the next section. If the installation is successful, proceed to [Post-Installation](#post-installation).

##### Manual - Not Recommended

1. [Download the latest release from GitHub](https://github.com/Yagisan/The-Bustling-Valley/releases). It will be named `The.Bustling.Valley.wabbajack
` Save it to a temporary folder. The recommended temporary folder is `C:\Temp\Valley`.
2. Open Wabbajack.

8. Wait for Wabbajack to finish
9. If you run into any issues see the next section. If the installation is successful, proceed to [Post-Installation](#post-installation).

#### Problems with Wabbajack

There are a lot of different scenarios where Wabbajack will produce an error. I recommend re-running Wabbajack before posting anything. Wabbajack will continue where it left off so you will not lose progress.

**Could not download x**:

If a mod updated and the old files were deleted, it is impossible to download them. You will need to be patent and wait for me to update the modlist.

**Wabbajack could not find my game folder**:

Wabbajack will not work with a pirated version of the game. If you own the game on Steam or GoG, go back to the [Pre-Installation](#pre-installation) step.

# Starting the Game

Head over to the installation folder and locate an executable named `ModOrganizer.exe` and launch it. This will be `C:\WJ\TBV\ModOrganizer.exe` if you have followed the recommended settings. Once it is launched, there will be a dropdown box on the top right and a big run button right next to it. Ensure it is set to SMAPI by selecting it in the dropdown box and then hitting the run button. You have to run SMAPI through Mod Organizer 2 in order to play The Bustling Valley.

# Choosing a Farm

This mod list should work with any farm, however they not all been extensively tested.

# Updating

If this Modlist receives an update please check the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) before doing anything. The [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) will advise if you will need to start a new game, or if your existing saves will continue working.

**Wabbajack will delete all files that are not part of the Modlist when updating!**

This means that any additional mods you have installed on top of the Modlist will be deleted. Your downloads folder will not be touched.

Updating is like installing. You only have to make sure that you select the same path and tick the _overwrite existing Modlist_ button.

# Noteworthy Mods

## Overhauls

**[Ridgeside Village](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7286)** is a huge expansion with over 50 new NPCs, a new village to the east of Pelican town, new quests and more.

**[Boarding House and Bus Stop Extension](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4120)** adds a boarding house behind the bus stop with several new NPCs. NPCs from other mods can make their homes here.

**[East Scarp](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5787)** adds a village to the west of Pelican town, and several new NPCs. NPCs from other mods can make their homes here.

**[Lunna - Astray in Stardew Valley](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/6626)** adds a new village, a special quest, new crops, fish and more.

## Skills and Professions

**[Capstone Professions](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7636)** adds a final choice of professions once you max out all your skills.

## Automation

**[Automate](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1063)** by placing a chest next to a machine (like a furnace or crystalarium), the machine will automatically pull raw items from the chest and push processed items into it. Connect multiple machines with a chest to link them.

**[Water Bot](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/8167)** by right-clicking with your watering can your farmer will go crop by crop watering them, expending the same amount of time and energy as if you had done it yourself to keep as vanilla as possible, but a lot less tedious!

**[Eidee Easy Fishing](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4806)** reduces the tediousness of fishing by automatically catching the fish for you. If you get a bite, and hook the fish, Eidee Easy Fishing will catch the fish. It is **not** an instant catch, nor will it automatically hook for you. Better rods, bait and tackle will improve catch speed and rates.

**[Better Junimos](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2221)** significantly improves Junimos: automatically plant crops, fertilize, work for a fee, increase range, and more!

**[Better Junimos Forestry](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/8992)** adds new skills to the Junimos. They can hoe your fields, grow wild trees for timber, look after your fruit trees, clear debris, and mow the lawn.

## Gameplay

**[Multiple Mini-Obelisks](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7900)** allows you to place more than 2 mini-obelisks, including outside the farm.

**[Horse Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7911)** makes the horse the way it should be, thin, fast and useful.

**[Better Ranching](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/859)** prevents failing milking/shearing attempts and adds an indicator when animals can be petted, milked, or sheared.

**[Watering Grants Experience And Crops Can Wither](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7768)** does exactly what it says. Manual watering grants some farming experience, and if not watered, your crops will die.

# Modifying the mod list

Modifying the mod list is not supported in any way, and is considered to be covered under the Wabbajack Discord Rule 11.

That said, I recognise that there are some mods that people may not like, and if disabled, will not functionally break the list.

Those mods can be found at the very top of the mod list, directly under the red separator that reads "**Uncheck to disable these mods only.**"

**[SpriteMaster](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4922)** is the mod that smooths out the graphics. It also provides a variety of performance boosts. Disable this mod for the classic Stardew Valley appearance.

**[Eidee Easy Fishing](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4806)** is the mod that enables easy fish catching. Disable this mod for the classic Stardew Valley fishing experience.


# Other Post Installation FAQ

## Why is it slow to start?

The Bustling Valley can take up to 10 minutes or so to start. While it may look like it has hung, it is still loading. The primary cause of the slowdown is a mod called [PyTK](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1726). This is used by many mods to load new maps, and is unfortunately not completely compatible with Stardew Valley 1.5.X, resulting in slow load times.

Additionally, [Json Assets](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1720) also slows down the start time of the game (although not to the extent PyTK does). The length of start up depends on how many JSON assets need to be loaded. Bigger mods, have many, many more assets than smaller mods. It doesn't affect runtime performance though.

Furthermore, to be able to coexist with manual modded installs and/or Nexus Collections, the Bustling Valley takes a quick backup of Stardew Valley before the game starts, makes it's needed changes, and restores that backup when you exit the game

Due to steps taken to remove dependencies on PyTK, loading times have been greatly improved since the 0.4.4 release of The Bustling Valley.

## Why does the game stutter between 6:00am and 6:10am?

Every day between 6:00am and 6:10am the game spawns in many objects. On some systems, this produces a noticeable lag or stutter when this occurs.

Staggering the spawns out over a longer period to avoid this was tried but this resulted in multiple stutters as each group of spawns triggered, rather than a single one, so that solution was rejected.

## I hate the new smooth graphics. How do I stop it?

Please see **Modifying the mod list**.

## Stardew Valley just automatically updated, is it safe to run this list?

Generally yes. The first time you load SMAPI will detect that the game has updated. It will need to restart. There will be an updated Bustling Valley release shortly after Stardew Valley releases. **The only exception is the Stardew Valley 1.6 release. That is expected to break many mods.**

## Does it work with a controller?

Several mods seem to behave erratically or not at all with a controller, so the official position is, **No**, it does not.

## Does this work in multiplayer?

Generally speaking this should work in multiplayer via the Internet, LAN, or local split screen mode. As with the unmodded game, some events may need to be triggered by the host, and/or each farmhand individually.

Please note that multiplayer primarily relies on community testing and bug reporting.

## Where is the Dwarf?

Please follow Professor Jaspers questline until the 6 heart stage.

## How do I use the WaterBot?

To use the WaterBot, select the watering can, then **right click** on a crop. Your farmer will automatically travel to, and water every crop they can reach. The will refill the watering can as needed, from the closest water source, and will stop when either all crops are watered, or the farmer is out of energy.

**WaterBot is not designed for a controller, and may behave erratically, or not at all if used with one.**

## How do I remove the Modlist?

Simply delete the installation folder (`C:\WJ\TBV` if you have been following this guide) and that will remove it, but why would you want to?

## Should I update SMAPI?

Not for the Bustling Valley. As of 0.4.4 the Bustling Valley now includes SMAPI, and this will be updated as needed in the Bustling Valley releases.

## What is the JSON Shuffle? Can it be fixed?

This is described [in depth here](https://stardewmodding.wiki/wiki/Json_Shuffle), but the short version is that adding, removing, or updating mods that use JSON assets in an ongoing save results in the items becoming messed up. **To avoid a JSON Shuffle, please wait until all machines have finished processing before updating this mod list**.

It's not fixable. Please don't alter this modlist once you start playing. **If you do get a shuffle, the best thing to do is to put all shuffled items in the shipping bin, or trash it.**

## How do I reset the configuration files?

Sometimes configuration files need to be reset. This is sometimes needed after the modlist is updated. Resetting the configuration files is very easy to do. Scroll to the very bottom of the mod list. There is a menu item named Overwrite.

![Rest_Config_Image](assets/images/Reset_Config.png)

**Right click** on it, and select **Clear Overwrite**. That's it. The game will regenerate any needed configuration files when you next start.

## Why are there trees in Ridgeside Village buildings?

The Bustling Valley 0.2.0+ includes Ridgeside Village 2.0 - this is a complete overhaul of the previous versions. The maps have changed. As a result you **must** start a new farm for the maps to look correct. You can not continue with your existing save.

## Why can I walk off the right side road of the bus stop?

The updated Bus Stop map was made to allow access to an NPC that is not included in this mod list. That NPC is accessed via the right side road. The original better bus stop map had an oversight from Ridgeside Village. When Pam returns from the desert, she drove through grass and fences. As of Ridgeside Village 2.0.3 this map is included as-is from Ridgeside Village.

## Why do farmhands only see a vanilla map?

There is a limitation in SMAPI's content API which makes it difficult for recolours or expansion mods to correctly update the map for farmhands in multiplayer. There's a planned change in the upcoming SMAPI 4.0.0 to address that.

## Fishing is too Easy. How to to fix this?

Please see **Modifying the mod list**.

## How do I exit the better sewers?

Run up the ladder, do not click on it. It no longer acts like a door.

## What will be removed in the 1.6 Stardew Valley update?

I (Yagisan) am currently in the Stardew Valley 1.6 alpha test, along with modders of major frameworks and expansions. The upcoming changes to Stardew Valley 1.6 will make several frameworks obsolete, as their functionality will become part of the vanilla game. Other frameworks however have been abandoned, and will not be ported to Stardew Valley 1.6 - there are replacement frameworks available, but not all mods have been ported over.

The following mods are expected to be removed when Stardew Valley 1.6 is released.

- [PyTK - Platonymous Toolkit](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1726) (Abandoned, and broken in Stardew Valley 1.5.5+)
- [TMXL Map Toolkit](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1820) (Abandoned, and broken in Stardew Valley 1.5.5+)

- [Denver - Male - Boarding House](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4594) (Requires PyTK)

## Known Bugs

Several of the mods included in The Bustling Valley have known bugs. These are being investigated and fixed by their respective teams. Be aware that this list may include spoilers about plot, and/or quest related details.

### Ridgeside Village

- At the Ridgeside Gathering Festival, Pika runs his normal shop rather than his festival shop with the special inventory. Because his normal shop opens at 9:30, and the festival starts at 9, if you arrive at the festival before 9:30, the shop will be closed.
- The patch that adds East Scarpe characters to Alissa's 8 heart event has not yet been updated to SAAT, meaning that the game will crash if you see Alissa's 8 heart event with ES installed.
- Jio, Daia, and Kiwi cannot be invited to the movies, even after the event, which makes them sociable.
- For the Crystal quests, you actually only need to complete the Red Crystal quest to progress in the storyline - The next event will trigger the day after you've completed that quest. There's no harm in continuing with the storyline without finishing all the crystals, other than maybe a break in continuity. The quests are untimed, so while you can't cancel them, you can finish them whenever you want. If you finish the Red Crystal quest first and don't want to go any further, avoid going into the Ridge after 8 PM.
